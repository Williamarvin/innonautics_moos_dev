plug_origin_warp.moos is referenced in meta_vehicle.moos and meta_shoreside.moos only

pmm/ can be where pMarineMaestro dumps files which you can iteratively test

pmm_backup/ contains the original mission files

All the plug files which are constant I put in plugs/

The tiff files are referenced in pmm/plug_pMarineViewer.moos, check the documentation for how you have to modify your path, where you can put the tiff files in pmm/ or pmm/tiffs/ depending on if you generate one or several

To run the mission you can do ./launch.sh {timewarp} for a basic simulation

i.e. ./launch.sh 5 
Will infer a simulation because in operations you do not use this command, and this will run at a timewarp of 5. This mission is immediately portable for running a single Heron.
