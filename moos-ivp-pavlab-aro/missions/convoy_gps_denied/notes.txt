When a behavior receives a task bid, it (IvPTaskBehavior) publishes

   TASK_BID_RCVD = id=wpt01, vname=abe, bid=23   (should add ownship=cal)?



Vehicle receives MISSION_TASK
 pTaskManager publishes TASK_WPT
 TaskWaypoint publishes BCM_REPORT_REQUEST
 ContagMgr    publishes CONTACTS_500
 TaskWaypoint publishes TASK_OUR_BID=23
                        NODE_MESSAGE_LOCAL --> ben TASK_BID=23
                        NODE_MESSAGE_LOCAL --> cal TASK_BID=23
                        NODE_MESSAGE_LOCAL --> deb TASK_BID=23


(1) Task Manager has received the task
(2) Task is of known type, and alert has been sent presumably for spawning

Snooping
(3) behavior has been spawned
    bid has been sent
    all bids received

Result


We would like pTaskManager on each vehicle to be sending the below status message to shoreside
whenever any of the fields change value:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASKMGR_STATUS   taskid=wpt01, received=true, generated=true, bidsent=true, allbids=true, bidwon=true,
                 flags_posted=2, xflags_posted=1
