o ensure plateaus enabled
o implement dynamic patience in legrun or waypoint bhv
o Enable extending legrun from JoustMgr

o Create option for pair of vehicles to R14 Joust always

o Create an overtaking mission

o Release standon when down to zero speed

o Split LegRunZ into parent/subclass

o Shrinking min/max util range based on speed

o uFldCollision detect that grades based on ROC during the encounter

o Shoreside control to make:
  - one vehicle CPA only
  - one vehicle oblivious
  - one vehicle slow/adversarial

o See Notable4
  one vehicle stuck in standon
  one vehicle stuck in some other zero speed mode, perhaps fixable
  with dynamic impatience

o Find a way to have a behavior publish a behavior mode, submode,
  and pull this into alogview IPFView and HelmPlot views

o uFldCollisionDetect
  - changing ranges based on ROC during encounter
  - detect loop-arounds
  - detect stalemates with configurable duration
