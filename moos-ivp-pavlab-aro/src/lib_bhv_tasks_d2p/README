Distance to point bids - only considers the straightline distance between two 
points to propose a bid. 

To use the dynamic loading of behaviors, you need to set the following 
environment variable (in your .cshrc file for tcsh users, or the equivalent
for bash users):

setenv IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIRS '/home/bob/moos-ivp-swarm/lib'
